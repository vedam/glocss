#### glocss – 1.0.2

These files are the css-starting-point in my projects.  
Inspired by [lit](https://ajusa.github.io/lit/) | [atomiks](https://atomiks.github.io/30-seconds-of-css/#constant-width-to-height-ratio)  
**⚠️ still under development**



Intention here is not to cover every use-case or ui-need, but to give a lean and lightweight base I'm able to extend if needed.

---

##### Lightweight footprint

The base without prism and cookie-consent weights:  
**10kb** minified  
**6kb** gzipped

---

##### install

```bash
# install as devDependency
npm i -D @vedam/glocss
```

---

##### todo

- add demo and examples
- finish forms
- Check integration of [postcss-preset-env](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env)
- Check integration of [csso](https://github.com/css/csso)
